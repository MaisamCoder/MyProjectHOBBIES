        <p id="P1">My Favorite Hobby is video games. After a long stressful day of school, video games are my way of cooling off, reliving stress, and having fun. It's a fun way to relax myself and its really fun and I find it really, really entertaining. Video games help me a lot through out the day and I just really enjoy playing them. There's so many games out there with so much creativity and it's just really cool. </p>

        <p id="P3">These games help me so much to relax and I just love playing them with friends to cool off and have a good time. Coding a game makes it even better because you get to make and play your own game, and show it to the world! It's so much fun! Even more fun than playing a game.

        <p id="P2">This is an image of my favorite character in a video game. The game that is the most fun with friends and super relaxing and fun to play, Valorant. The other image is coding, it may look like a bunch of numbers because of the image, but when you start by basics you'll slow start to get love for coding and you want to make more than you can imagine.</p>

        <p id="P3">These are my favorite characters I like to play in game. Because they're cool fun, and overpowered. They're super fun to play and this is only 2 out of the 15 agents in the game. I love this game, and it's really fun. One day, when I get more advanced at my coding, I want to design an agent myself.
